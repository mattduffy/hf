To launch the Jupyter notebook server, run:

```bash
cd <courses_dir>
# Create the virtual environment if it does not already exist.
python3 -m venv --name=courses
# Activate the venv.
source ./courses/bin/activate
# Create the jupyter kernel for this venv before launching notebook for the first time.
python3 -m pip install ipykernel
python3 -m ipykernel --user --name=courses --display-name="Python3 (courses)"
# Launch jupyter as notebook server. 
/opt/homebrew/bin/jupyter notebook
```

Make sure to use the "Python3 (courses)" notebook kernel.  This will ensure that any packages installed inside a notebook for these courses will be installed in this virtual environment, rather than the system python3 root.
